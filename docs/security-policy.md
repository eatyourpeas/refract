# Security Policy

## Overview

The Refract application implements **enterprise-grade security measures** to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure safe operation in production environments. This document outlines our comprehensive security posture and the protections in place.

## Security Principles

Our security implementation is built on the following principles:

- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Least Privilege**: Users can only access their own data
- **Input Validation**: All user input is validated and sanitized
- **Secure by Default**: Security measures are enabled automatically
- **Monitoring & Logging**: All security events are tracked and auditable

## Authentication & Access Control

### Rate Limiting Protection

The application implements strict rate limiting to prevent abuse:

- **Login Attempts**: Limited to 5 attempts per minute per connection
- **Account Creation**: Limited to 3 new accounts per minute per connection
- **Password Reset**: Limited to 2 attempts per minute per connection

These limits protect against brute force attacks, account enumeration, and spam registrations.

### Session Management

- **Session Duration**: 30-day login expiration for security and usability balance
- **Password Reset Window**: 1-day token expiration for password reset requests
- **Secure Cookies**: Session tokens are handled securely by Meteor's built-in mechanisms

### Account Security

- **Account Lockout**: Temporary lock after 5 failed login attempts within 15 minutes
- **Password Security**: Passwords are hashed using bcrypt (Meteor default)
- **Email Verification**: Email format validation on registration
- **Profile Validation**: Username must be 2-50 characters

### Input Validation

All user input is validated before processing:

- **Email Validation**: Strict email format checking using regex patterns
- **Profile Name**: Length limits (2-50 characters) and validation
- **Score Validation**: Game scores must be numeric and within valid range (0-3600 seconds)
- **Type Checking**: All method parameters are validated using Meteor's `check()` package

## Database Security

### Access Controls

The application enforces strict database access controls:

- **Method-Only Access**: All database operations must go through validated Meteor methods
- **User Isolation**: Users can only access and modify their own data
- **Field Filtering**: Only necessary user fields are published to clients
- **Deny Rules**: Direct client-side database operations are explicitly denied

### Collection Security

The `PlayersList` collection implements:

- **Insert Validation**: Verify user authentication and data structure
- **Update Restrictions**: Users can only update their own records
- **Field Restrictions**: Only `topScore` field can be updated
- **Remove Control**: Users can only remove their own records

### Data Minimization

- **Limited Data Collection**: Only email, username, and game scores are stored
- **No Sensitive Data**: No payment information or personal identifiers collected
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Old audit logs are automatically removed after 30 days
- **No Third-Party Tracking**: No external analytics or tracking services

## Network Security

### Security Headers

The application sets comprehensive HTTP security headers:

- **X-Content-Type-Options**: `nosniff` - Prevents MIME type confusion attacks
- **X-Frame-Options**: `DENY` - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection**: `1; mode=block` - Enables browser XSS filtering
- **Strict-Transport-Security**: HTTPS enforcement (production only)
- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts script execution and resource loading

### Server Information

- **Server Header Removal**: Server identification headers are removed
- **Error Message Sanitization**: Generic error messages prevent information disclosure

## Monitoring & Audit Logging

### Audit Trail

The application maintains a comprehensive audit log in the `AuditLog` collection:

- **Failed Login Attempts**: Logs user ID, timestamp, IP address, and error details
- **Suspicious Activity**: Tracks unusual patterns and potential security events
- **Connection Information**: Records client IP addresses when available
- **Automatic Retention**: Logs are automatically cleaned up after 30 days

### Security Monitoring

The system monitors:

- Failed login attempts and patterns
- New user registrations and rates
- Suspicious connection patterns
- Invalid input attempts
- Rate limit violations

## Protection Against Common Attacks

| Attack Type | Protection Method | Implementation |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|
| **Brute Force** | Rate limiting + account lockout | 5 attempts/minute limit, 15-min lockout |
| **Data Theft** | Access controls + validation | User-specific data access only |
| **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)** | Input sanitization + CSP headers | Script injection prevention |
| **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** | Meteor's built-in protection | Automatic token validation |
| **Clickjacking** | X-Frame-Options header | Frame embedding blocked |
| **Man-in-the-Middle** | HTTPS enforcement | Secure transport required |
| **Account Enumeration** | Rate limiting + generic errors | Limited information disclosure |
| **SQL Injection** | Parameterized queries | MongoDB native protection |

## Production Deployment Security

### Required Environment Variables

```bash
# Database connection (use secure connection string)
MONGO_URL=mongodb://[secure-connection-string]

# Application root URL (must use HTTPS)
ROOT_URL=https://yourdomain.com

# Email service for password resets
MAIL_URL=smtp://[email-service]

# Production environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Database Security Requirements

- **Enable Authentication**: MongoDB must have authentication enabled
- **Use SSL/TLS**: Database connections must use encrypted transport
- **Restrict Access**: Limit database access to application servers only
- **Regular Backups**: Implement encrypted backup strategy
- **Connection Logging**: Enable database connection logging

### Network Security Requirements

- **HTTPS Only**: SSL/TLS certificates required (Let's Encrypt or commercial)
- **Firewall Rules**: Configure firewall to restrict access
- **VPN Access**: Use VPN for administrative database access
- **Reverse Proxy**: Deploy behind nginx or similar for additional security

### Before Deployment Checklist
