# 🔧 GitHub Actions Secrets Setup

## 📋 **Required Repository Secrets**

To enable automatic deployment, you need to add these secrets to your GitHub repository:

### **Step 1: Go to Repository Settings**
1. Navigate to your GitHub repository: `https://github.com/eatyourpeas/refract`
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Click **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**
4. Click **New repository secret**

### **Step 2: Add Railway Secrets**

#### **RAILWAY_TOKEN**
```bash
# Get your Railway token:
1. Sign up at https://railway.app
2. Go to Account Settings → Tokens
3. Click "Create New Token"
4. Copy the token (starts with railway_...)
5. Add as GitHub secret: RAILWAY_TOKEN
```

#### **RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID**
```bash
# Get your project ID after deploying:
1. Create Railway project from GitHub
2. In project dashboard, go to Settings
3. Copy the Project ID
4. Add as GitHub secret: RAILWAY_PROJECT_ID
```

## 🚀 **Current CI/CD Status**

### **✅ Working Features**
- ✅ **Testing**: Runs on all PRs and pushes
- ✅ **Security Scanning**: Vulnerability detection
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Syntax and config verification
- ✅ **Build Verification**: Ensures app builds successfully

### **⏳ Pending Setup**
- ⏳ **Auto-deployment**: Needs Railway secrets (see above)

## 🏃‍♂️ **Quick Railway Setup**

### **Option 1: Manual Deployment (Immediate)**
```bash
# Deploy manually without CI/CD
npm install -g @railway/cli
railway login
railway init
railway up
```

### **Option 2: GitHub Integration (Recommended)**
1. **Sign up at Railway**: https://railway.app
2. **Connect GitHub**: Authorize railway to access your repositories
3. **Deploy from repo**: Select `eatyourpeas/refract` repository
4. **Add MongoDB**: Add database service in Railway dashboard
5. **Set environment variables**: 
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `ROOT_URL=https://your-app.railway.app`
   - `MONGO_URL=<from Railway MongoDB service>`
6. **Get secrets**: Copy token and project ID to GitHub secrets
7. **Push to deploy branch**: Automatic deployment will now work!

## 🔒 **Security Notes**

### **Secret Management**
- ✅ Secrets are encrypted in GitHub
- ✅ Only accessible to repository collaborators
- ✅ Not visible in logs or pull requests
- ✅ Can be rotated anytime

### **Access Control**
- ✅ Deploy only triggers from `deploy` branch
- ✅ Only runs for repository owner pushes
- ✅ Requires all tests to pass first

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **CI/CD Failing?**
```bash
# Check these common issues:
1. Are all tests passing? Check the test tab
2. Are Railway secrets set correctly?
3. Is Railway project created and linked?
4. Are you pushing to the 'deploy' branch?
```

### **Railway Deployment Failing?**
```bash
# Common fixes:
1. Check MONGO_URL is set correctly
2. Verify ROOT_URL matches Railway domain
3. Ensure NODE_ENV=production is set
4. Check Railway project has sufficient resources
```

Your CI/CD pipeline is production-ready! Just add the Railway secrets to enable auto-deployment. 🚀
