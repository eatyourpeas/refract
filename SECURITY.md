# üîí Security Checklist for Refract App Deployment

## ‚úÖ Implemented Security Measures

### Authentication & Access Control
- [x] **Rate Limiting**: Login attempts limited to 5 per minute per IP
- [x] **Account Creation Limits**: 3 new accounts per minute per IP  
- [x] **Password Reset Limits**: 2 attempts per minute per IP
- [x] **Session Management**: 30-day login expiration
- [x] **Account Lockout**: Temporary lock after 5 failed attempts
- [x] **Input Validation**: Email format and profile name validation
- [x] **User Data Filtering**: Only necessary fields published to client

### Database Security
- [x] **Method-Only Access**: All database operations through validated Meteor methods
- [x] **User Isolation**: Users can only access/modify their own data
- [x] **Input Sanitization**: Score validation and type checking
- [x] **Audit Logging**: Failed login attempts and suspicious activity logged
- [x] **Automatic Cleanup**: Old audit logs removed after 30 days

### Network Security
- [x] **Security Headers**: X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, etc.
- [x] **Content Security Policy**: Restricts resource loading
- [x] **Server Information Hiding**: Removes server identification headers
- [x] **CORS Configuration**: Proper cross-origin request handling

## üö® Additional Deployment Security Steps

### Before Going Live

1. **Remove Development Packages**
   ```bash
   meteor remove autopublish insecure
   ```

2. **Environment Variables** (Set these in production)
   ```bash
   MONGO_URL=mongodb://[secure-connection-string]
   ROOT_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   MAIL_URL=smtp://[email-service] # For password resets
   ```

3. **Database Security**
   ```bash
   # MongoDB security
   - Enable authentication on MongoDB
   - Use SSL/TLS for database connections
   - Restrict database access to application servers only
   - Regular database backups with encryption
   ```

4. **Network Security**
   ```bash
   # Deploy with HTTPS only
   - Use SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt or commercial)
   - Configure firewall rules
   - Use VPN for database access
   - Enable database connection logging
   ```

### Monitoring & Alerting

5. **Set Up Monitoring**
   - Monitor failed login attempts via AuditLog collection
   - Set alerts for unusual activity patterns
   - Monitor database connection attempts
   - Track application performance and errors

6. **Regular Security Updates**
   - Keep Meteor and packages updated
   - Monitor security advisories
   - Regular security audits
   - Backup and disaster recovery procedures

## üõ°Ô∏è Data Protection Measures

### What's Protected
- **Email addresses**: Only accessible to the user who owns them
- **User profiles**: Names limited to 50 characters, validated format
- **Game scores**: Users can only modify their own scores
- **Authentication**: Passwords hashed using bcrypt (Meteor default)

### What's Logged (For Security Monitoring)
- Failed login attempts (IP, timestamp, user)
- Account creation attempts
- Suspicious activity patterns
- Database access patterns

### Data Minimization
- No sensitive data collected beyond email/username
- Profile data limited to game-relevant information
- Automatic cleanup of old audit logs
- No third-party tracking or analytics

## üîß Production Deployment Commands

```bash
# 1. Build for production
meteor build --directory ../build --server-only

# 2. Set security environment variables
export MONGO_URL="mongodb://secure-connection"
export ROOT_URL="https://yourdomain.com"
export NODE_ENV="production"

# 3. Deploy with security headers
# (Use reverse proxy like nginx for additional security)
```

## üìä Security Metrics to Monitor

- Failed login attempts per hour/day
- New account creation rate
- Database query patterns
- Connection attempts and origins
- Error rates and types

## üö® Incident Response

If you detect suspicious activity:
1. Check AuditLog collection for patterns
2. Review connection logs
3. Consider temporary rate limit adjustments
4. Monitor for data access anomalies
5. Update security measures as needed

## üìû Additional Recommendations

For enhanced security consider:
- **Two-factor authentication** (future enhancement)
- **Email verification** for new accounts
- **CAPTCHA** for registration/login
- **Professional security audit** before major deployment
- **Dedicated security monitoring service**
