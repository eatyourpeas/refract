## üÜò **Troubleshooting Common Issues**

### **App Won't Start**
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs --service your-service-name

# Common fixes:
# 1. Verify MONGO_URL is correct
# 2. Check NODE_ENV=production is set
# 3. Ensure ROOT_URL matches Railway domain
```

### **Database Connection Failed**
```bash
# Test MongoDB connection
mongo "your-mongo-connection-string"

# Common fixes:
# 1. Check MongoDB service is running in Railway
# 2. Verify connection string format
# 3. Ensure IP whitelisting is configured
```

### **SSL/HTTPS Issues**
```bash
# Railway provides automatic SSL
# If issues persist:
# 1. Check ROOT_URL uses https://
