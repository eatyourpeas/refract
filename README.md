## Background
Teaching optometry students how to work out refractive errors in the clinical setting is like teaching doctors physical examination or bakers-to-be how to use an oven. It is a core skill and needs to be done well. Andy Gridley has been doing this for years as a University Lecturer and wanted to gamify the process, to allow students to practice on a computer to maximise the face to face time they have with volunteer patients.

## Tools
Refract is written in Meteor and JS using [createjs](https://createjs.com/).

## Rules
The student has to work out the refractive error of the patient by dragging lenses of different strengths onto the frame and assessing the reported refractive error from the Snellen chart. A timer logs the time taken to get a correct prescription. Fastest times are logged to a leader board.

## Set up

1. Install Meteor 1.2
2. ```meteor```
